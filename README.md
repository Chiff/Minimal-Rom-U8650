Hi,

my name is Chiff and i'm user of Sonic about 2 years. I had root and tried many ROMs. Now, I tried to build my own ROM.

This ROM is based on Veloz46's Minimalistic rom v1.0.3,
but it has new overclocable kernel + some apps,
ROM is now under developpement but i want to show it.

Disclaimer!
I take no responsibility for any brick of your Sonic U8650, then do so at your own risk, and I I recommend to do this only after being certain that you understand what you do and you understand the meaning.

Minimal Rom v0.x 

Status (2. 2. 1h PM): All problems solved! :)

How to:

1.
You have to download RECOVERY + ROM
- Clockworkmod/TWRP - download HERE
- put ROM on SD card - choose download

2.
Turn on ADB debugging, turn off Fast boot, power off phone.
Start recovery.bat (on PC)
Connect Phone to PC and hold vol down and power

3.
Boot into recovery vol UP and power
I suggest you to make nandroid backup if something went wrong
Select WIPE (cache+data+factory reset)
Select install and find on your SD card Minimal Rom v0.x

4.
Reboot device and...Hurray! that's all  :)
If any problem report to me, i'm using this rom too,
